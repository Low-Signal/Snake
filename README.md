# Snake
* Classic snake game with some extras
* Snake-V3.py is the most up to date version of the game.
* SnakeAndDB.py is used to connect the game to a database as the original purpose of the game was to be a part of a larger gaming suite complete with a highscore list.

# Features
* Score is kept and displayed at the top right of the screen.
* 10% chance for the "apple" the snake eats to spawn multiple purple "apples" to eat.
* Screen wrapping so the snake can go off one side of the screen and enter the other.
* Your snake moves slightly faster with each "apple" it eats.
